INPUT_FILE_FORMAT=Input file format description:\n\
States are numbered with non-negative integers.\n\
States correspond to rows in ascending state number.\n\
The format of the string is as follows: \n\
<sn><space><probability><spaces>...<sn><space><probability><spaces><sn><space><probability>\n\
<probability> \u2013 decimal number;\n\
<sn> \u2013 state number, that is, some decimal integer from 0 to \uD835\uDC3E - 1, where \uD835\uDC3E is the number of lines.\n\
In the line, state numbers are not repeated;\n\
<spaces> \u2013 this is a number of spaces.
INVALID_INPUT_DATA=Invalid input data.
INVALID_PROBABILITY=The sum of the initial probability distribution must be equal to 1.
